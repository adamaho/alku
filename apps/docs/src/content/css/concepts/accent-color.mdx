description: Customize the accent color of your application.

Users and companies often have a preference for the accent color of their applications. Winnie CSS supports this using the `data-accent-color` attribute. The accent color attribute modifies the `--wui-color-accent-<value>` css variables which will affect any components that use those variables.

```tsx title="root.tsx" ins="class="winnie-ui"" ins="data-accent-color="purple""
export default function Root() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head></head>
      <body class="winnie-ui" data-accent-color="purple">
        <App />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Any color that Winnie CSS supports can be used as an accent color, including [custom colors](/css/docs/concepts/colors#customizing-colors).
