Goho Tailwind includes all features included with Goho CSS along with all of the benefits of using tailwind. You can think of it as an extension to Goho CSS that exposes all features as tailwind utilities. We have created a custom tailwind theme that can be used with [Tailwind v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha).

## Installation

Let's get you up and running with Goho Tailwind. These instructions assume you have already configured tailwind in your application.

### 1. Install Goho Tailwind

Using the package manager of your choice, install Goho Tailwind from your command line:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash frame="none"
    npm install @goho/tailwind
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```bash frame="none"
    yarn add @goho/tailwind
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash frame="none"
    pnpm add @goho/tailwind
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```bash frame="none"
    bun install @goho/tailwind
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Import the CSS

Import the Goho Tailwind file in the root css file of your application:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```css title="global.css"
@import "@goho/tailwind";
```

### 3. Configure Goho CSS

Configure the `body` element with Goho CSS specific attributes

```tsx title="root.tsx" {6-9}
export default function Root() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head></head>
      <body
        class="goho"
        data-accent-color="orange"
        data-scaling="100%"
        data-radius="md"
      >
        <App />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 4. Start Building

Your app is now ready to go with Goho Tailwind.

```tsx title="button.tsx"
export const MyButton = ({ children }: React.PropsWithChildren) => {
  return (
    <button className="bg-accent-9 text-accent-contrast h-[calc(32px * var(--go-scaling))] px-3 rounded-2">
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```
